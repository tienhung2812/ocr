# Intent-classification
Intent classification using LSTM keras


Intent classification is used in chatbots to classify the user intent.
I used a dataset from the below URL.

https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines

The dataset contains sentences for 4 different types of intents

Book_Restaurant,  GetWeather, PlayMusic, RateBook

I used an LSTM network to classify intents based on user input.
